# FamilyFriendlyFractals
Generates random Julia sets from a seed.
Changable generation style.
I dont know how to use git so code might be fucked sometimes.
I dont know rust either so code might be fucked.

Somehow i managed to add the functionality of generating fractals from pictures and its awesome!
